						TIPS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE 
WHILE WRITING C CODE


 1) Copy the contents of a memory location to a temporary variable and use the
 temporary variable, if multiple accesses are required to reach the memory
 location. 

 For example,

in.inner->innermost->a = atoi(argv[1]);
in.inner->innermost->b = atoi(argv[2]);
in.inner->innermost->a = in.inner->innermost->a + atoi(argv[3]);
in.inner->innermost->b = in.inner->innermost->b + atoi(argv[3]);

can be changed to :
innermost *optvar = in.inner->innermost;

optvar->a = atoi(argv[1]);
optvar->b = atoi(argv[2]);
optvar->a = optvar->a + atoi(argv[3]);
optvar->b = optvar->b + atoi(argv[3]);


But, this change has no effect on O2 optimization and above. For O0 and O1 there
is a reduction in the assembly code footprint.
