physical memory, vmem and then on top of that kmem

kmem allocates from vmem

slab is one or more pages divided into equal size chunks.

now each chunk is divided into usable buffer and rest..that is suppose u ask for
40 bytes but the chunk size is say 50 bytes..then 40 bytes is usable buffer and 
unused 10 is maintained by kmem.


magazine container for buffers
per cpu magazine 

group of pre allocated buffers.


sbrk, mmap, malloc
