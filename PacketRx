mac_rx()
	-> The underlying driver passes each packet to mac_rx()
	-> calls mac_rx_ring()

mac_rx_ring()
	-> This is invoked when packets are recieved by MAC driver in the 
interrupt
	context.
	-> The driver provides a ring generation number, if it is same as the 
one in
	mac then forward the packets up the stack else drop them.
	-> call mac_rx function in mac_impl_t
	-> possible values of mac_rx are mac_rx_common() and mac_rx_bridge()


mac_rx_common()
	-> This is called for interrupt, poll and bridge rx paths.
	-> mac_promisc_dispatch() sends a copy of mblk chain to sender mac 
client.
	If there are promiscuous mode callbacks for the mac, then pass the copy
	using mac_promisc_dispatch()
	-> if a ring is specified then process accordingly or else go for 
software
	classification.
	-> if hardware ring is specified
		-> get the group of the ring
		-> get the corresponding flow of the group
