Physical NIC is placed inside a PCIe slot. It autonegotiates the speed with the
other end it is connected to. When the OS boots, drivers enumerate
all devices on the board. It figures out the corresponding driver for the
inserted NIC. 

The driver registers itself to mac. The driver provides the mac with physical
stats like autonegotiated speed.
