leaf group -> all memory handled by one controller, for each cpu the access is
	same
mnode -> memnode divided into tiles . each tile is subdivided in tilelets (256 )
	for synch issue. A tilechunk is atleast as largest page size.
	kernel cage where kernel memory is allocated. But u cant put kernel cage in
	one board, because all lwps will access it causing bus contention. so we
	need to spread the kernel throughout the memory.

tlb ->  where is virtual memory for a give process

tsp -> cache tlb.


freemem is a variable gives free memory in pages. page size is there in
another global variable is _pagesize.

nproc is no. of process in current system. nthread is number of thread is
current system

addrofprocess::print proc_t p_tlist->t_pri

base page size is smallest pagesize for architecture.
