When we create a process we need to reserve memory for anon pages in swap.
This is because if we have to page out..for non-anon pages we have backup
in filesystem..but for data segment and other anon pages we dont have any
place to back it up..this is why when we create a process and malloc or do
any opertion that involves anon pages we need to allocate memory is swap
so that we have a place to back it up, when we have to page.

Now this swap space is actually virtual swap space which is physical memory
+ actual disk swap space. This is done


swap unit is called block, not page.

root@solaris11:~# swap -sh
total: 319M allocated + 188M reserved = 504M used, 2.9G available

allocated - reserved but allocated in maim memory
reserved  - reserved but not allocated in main memory
